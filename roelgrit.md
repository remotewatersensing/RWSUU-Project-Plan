Excerpt from Roel Grit's Project Management fifth edition chapter 1 and 6:

## SMART
Projects are carried out in order to achieve the sponsor’s goal. The result
aimed for by the project group must meet the sponsor’s objectives. A
result and an objective could both be defined within a SMART framework,
and if a project is involved, it is essential to do so. SMART stands for:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Acceptable
- Realistic
- Time-bound

### Specific
The project result must be specific, i.e. described in detail. In other words,
what exactly are we going to do? There should be no misunderstanding as
to the end result. For example, ‘We’re going to improve the delivery of our
products’ is not specific enough. More specific would be to say ‘We need
to shorten the delivery time for our products’.

### Measurable
The result must be measurable. This means that it should be possible
afterwards to determine whether the result has been reached (or not) with
regard to time, money, quality and quantity. Measurability is also important
for determining when the result is actually reached: When am I finished?
For example, ‘The delivery time of our products must be reduced from five
to two days.’

### Acceptable
A person or group must be responsible for achieving the result. So who will
that be? The result must also be achievable for the person who must
achieve it. For example, ‘The Logistics Department must agree that this is
indeed a feasible option.’

### Realistic
The intended project result must be feasible and realistic. Can we achieve
this result? If the goal is not realistic, the project members will have little
interest in pursuing it and will quit. For example, ‘The Logistics Department
must reduce the delivery time of our product from five to three days’ (since
‘two days’ was not realistic).

### Time-bound
There is a specific deadline by which the result must be achieved. For
example, ‘The Logistics Department must reduce the delivery time of our
products from five to two days by December 31 of this year.’
The following are two examples in which goals have been defined according
to the SMART principle.

## Background
The future members of the project team, the organisation in which the
project is being carried out, and the outside world will need background
information about the project. One way of doing this is including the
information – the ‘project environment’ – in the project plan. The
information should be such that even the uninitiated can form a picture of
both the project and the organisation in which the project is being carried
out.

-	Give your project a clear, preferably original, and catchy name! This
makes it easier to remember within the organisation. Examples of
memorable names are Decibel (switch to 10-digit telephone numbers at
KPN Telecom) and Operation Desert Storm (the first war between Iraq
and the United States) and the North/South line (subway connection
between Amsterdam North and Amsterdam South).

-	State the organisation commissioning the project (i.e. the party that is
paying for it) and the person who is acting as the sponsor. The sponsor
must approve the final project plan. He or she will also want to evaluate
the results at the end of the project.

-	State the person or organisation that is carrying out the project. Also
state the person ultimately responsible for the completion of the
project. This does not have to be written in detail since it is worked
out in more detail in Section 7 of the project plan, which covers
project organisation.

-	Give a description of the organisation in which the project is being carried out. What does the company do? What departments does it
have? Who answers to whom? The best technique is to describe the
background elements in order of decreasing size: for example, first
the company, then the business unit, and finally the department (see
Figure 6.3).

-	Give an account of the project’s history. Why is this project important?
Is this project a continuation of another project? What were that
project’s outcomes? How does that project affect this one? How does
this project relate to others still in the pipeline?

-  Indicate the stakeholders of the project (see Section 2.2), i.e. those
with an interest in the final results of the project. Also state what their
interest in the end product is, regardless of the outcome.

-  Briefly describe how the sponsor will be approving the project plan.

-	Give a short description of the layout of the various section of the
project plan.

## Project Results
A description of the project’s objectives and a description of the intended
project’s results. The results must relate directly to the objectives and if
relevant, to plans for an assignment relating to the project.

### The Why
The project’s objectives – its goal – should tell you why the sponsor wants
the product in question. They should provide an indication of what the
sponsor wishes to achieve via the project. As such, the sponsor ‘owns’ the
project’s objectives. The objectives of the sponsor must be able to
contribute to his organisation’s overall objectives.

Some examples of objectives follow:
- increase profit margins or market share
- find a solution for an existing production problem or speed the
production process up
- promote health or shorten hospital waiting lists
- promote the integration of minority groups
- become more socially responsible by limiting the amount of waste
produced by the company or reducing energy usage
- resolve student housing issues

The project plan may be broken down into a number of sub-objectives.
While it are the project’s results that are usually described as SMART,
project objectives must also be as SMART as possible. You would be well
advised to reread SMART.

### The What
The most important element of the project plan is the description of the
project’s aimed-for result. In it, the writer (who will probably be the project
manager) will describe what needs to be delivered by the end of the
project: the finished product.

Since it represents the project’s end-product, the description given of it
must be as precise as possible. Discuss the product thoroughly with the
sponsor: there must be no doubt at all about it. If there is, the project will
be a failure before it even starts.

This applies to all of the elements of the project as well: they all depend on
the definition of the product to be delivered and so the nature of that
product must be very clear. After all, how can you possibly plan to produce
something if you do not know exactly what that something is? How can you
estimate what the project is going to cost if you are uncertain about its
result? A project will stand or fall on its description.

It is preferable to break your end-product down into its various
components. If you have drawn up a statement of requirements in
conjunction with your sponsor, you could base your description of the
result on it. It will constitute a specification of the project results.

As you formulate your description of the project’s results, ask yourself the
following questions:

-	What tangible products or deliverables are there at the end of the project?
-	What does it look like? While that might be hard to answer at this stage,
try to make the picture in your head as real as possible. You might try
sketching it, writing a description of it or mind-mapping it.
-	What requirements do your project end-product or solution to a problem
have to meet?
-	What concrete contribution will the end-product make to achieving the
project’s goals or business objectives?

### Formulating a Research Question
If your project is a research project, in addition to formulating the research
objectives you will need to formulate the research problem. This should
take the form of a research question (Grit & Julsing, 2009). A research
report written on the basis of the research that has been performed must
address that research question. The research problem may need to be
broken down into a number of individual questions. The project plan is
usually termed the research plan.

If you are doing research you will be aiming for an end-product of a highly
tangible sort: the research report, perhaps supplemented by a presentation or
a public defence of the findings. What goes into the research report could be
specified further: you could describe the nature of the information the report
will contain or show a preliminary structuring of the chapters and sections.

## Project Activities
After you have described the project’s results – the desired end-product –
you will have to devise tasks (activities) aimed at realising that end-product.
Describing the end-product in precise terms will make it easier to devise
those tasks.
If you are a doing a particular type of research for the first time you will
probably be quite uncertain what needs to be done. Consider picking the
brains of people who have done similar projects. They may be able to help
you think up relevant tasks.
It is also helpful to create a Work Breakdown Structure (see Section
4.7). The following action points must be kept in mind when planning
activities.

- Try to identify the activities that have to be carried out as completely as
possible. If you do not, you may find it impossible to draw up a useful
planning and cost calculations properly.
- Include the preliminary design in the list of activities. 
- Try to group the activities in a logical manner. Give each group of
activities a group title. Grouping provides clarity and is useful when the
planning are being drawn up (also see example 6.5).
-	When you are grouping the activities, arrange them by level according to
the amount of work required. A level could be (from the top down): a
phase, a group or an activity.
- At this point, you do not have to worry about when an activity should be
carried out and by whom. Once the project members are lined up, you
can detail this in your project plan (Section 8: ‘Planning’).

It is not necessary to include the weekly project meetings in the section on
project activities (Chapter 3). Such meetings are included in ‘The project
organisation’, Section 7 of your project plan (see Figure 6.2).

## Project Boundaries
What falls within the project’s scope and what does not is frequently
unclear. Sometimes it seems clear, but it later turns out that sponsor and
the project manager had their own interpretation.
In order to prevent unclear situations from developing, you should describe
the boundaries of the project.
An unclear scope is a major threat to any project, and projects often fail on
this point. After all, if it is unclear what is and what is not part of a project,
then it is by definition impossible to draw up a proper planning. In defining
the boundaries, ask yourself the following two important questions:

-	When does the project finish?
-	What does the project include? 

Everything that is carried out as part of the project is called the ‘scope’ of
the project. The word ‘scope’ literally means size, range and domain.

As was suggested above, misunderstandings based on uncertainty about
what is and what is not part of the project should be avoided at all costs.
Demarcate the project clearly:

-	Determine whether those activities that could be considered ‘borderline’
are part of the project.
- Indicate those borderline activities that do not fall within the project
scope. It may seem strange to list activities that will not be done, but
this makes it very clear for both the sponsor and the project manager.
- Indicate when the project will start as well as the repercussions of
starting at a later date.
- Indicate the project’s completion date.
- Indicate the maximum amount of the budget.
-	Stipulate the preconditions that have to be met for the project to have a
chance of success.

Preconditions are factors that the project group usually has little control
over, but which must be satisfied in order to ensure a successful project.
They serve as a ‘warning’ to the sponsor: ‘Dear Sponsor, make sure that...
is taken care of or your project will fail.’ In other words, what does the
sponsor need to do to make sure the project is a success?
Examples of preconditions are: sales must be made available, another
project must be finished first, the right tools must be made available or
permission must be received from the municipality before construction can
begin.

## Interim Results
Your project group will carry out a number of activities. These will result in
all sorts of intermediate results or ‘products’. In this context, the term
‘intermediate result’ should be interpreted broadly: it need not refer to a
physical object. An event such as the official opening of a building can also
be an intermediate result. It is important to identify the result and to work
towards it.

Since you are producing an intermediate result (product) and doing so to a
deadline, the project’s progress is measurable. You can regard an important
intermediate result as a milestone in the planning.
However, having too many milestones can distort the picture.


## Quality
The section on quality control in the project plan (Section 6) deals with the
quality of the end product (and all intermediate products) referred to in the
previous section. How can you guarantee their quality? Keep in mind that it
is the sponsor who ultimately decides whether the quality of the end result
(end product) of the project is sufficient. But how can you make sure this
quality is sufficient? You can guarantee the quality in the following ways:

-	Describe the desired quality of the end product . Also describe how the sponsor will
assess this quality after the project has been completed.
-  The sponsor will have to be reassured early on – during the project –
about the quality of the project and project results. You can do this in
advance in your project plan by determining how you plan to assess the
quality of each of the intermediate results while carrying out the project.
-  Indicate what checks will be carried out to guarantee the quality. These
could include both test and technical procedures.
-	Obtaining feedback on a project plan, a management summary, a report
or an interview is a way of guaranteeing its quality.
- Request external advice. You could have a product or an intermediate
result evaluated by an expert from outside your project team. For
example, if your project requires you to draw up a questionnaire, it is
advisable to have the questions assessed by a specialist in the field.
- Indicate the standards and techniques that apply to and are used within
the organisation. If these do not yet exist, establish the standards
yourself. If necessary, consult other interested parties.
- Indicate the tools and techniques to be employed in making the
diagrams and drawings.
- Indicate what software is used. You could, for example, specify the word
processor, project planning software and other software. Make an effort
to standardize the systems and thus make them more interconnectable.
If you deviate from the organisation’s commonly used standards, explain
why.

Speed and quality are often conflicting goals. If you rush through an
activity you may gain in terms of time but not quality. Delivering quality
costs both time and money. There must be a balance between the quality
that is delivered and the effort that this takes. Too high a standard of
quality may cost too much. The layout of a report on an interview, for
example, need not meet the same standards as the layout of an
advertising brochure.


## Project Organization
A project falls outside of the normal business of an organisation. You must
make it clear to all parties involved what role they and others will play in
the project plan and what the rules for personal interaction are.
Information is also essential for the organisation of a project and is
discussed in this section.

### Organisation
When writing a project plan, you need to find suitable project members,
ones who have the right expertise and the right skills. Make sure you have
a well-balanced team (see the Belbin roles in Section 2.10). You will also
have to negotiate with the sponsor and other relevant parties about using
these people for your project. Since naturally you want only the best people
for your project, you might meet some resistance.
The following positions could be considered:

- Project Manager
- Working Group Manager (if applicable)
- Project Secretary
- Project Team Member
- Adviser
Assign the positions and tasks to the various individuals. This should be
done in consultation with the sponsor and the departmental heads.
- List the names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of all
project members.
- Indicate the required availability of the team members (full-time, 2 days
a week, etc.). Vacations and other days off must be taken into
consideration and set out clearly in agreements. This is particularly
important: if the agreements are not lived up to, this will have direct
repercussions on the completion date of your project.
- Link the positions to individuals.
-	Establish what authority each project member holds and what his or her
responsibilities are (also see Chapter 2, ‘People working on projects’).
- Indicate how and to whom you will report (i.e. to whom you are
accountable). This may, for example, be the steering committee, the
board of directors or the departmental heads.
-	With larger projects, it may be necessary to receive secretarial support
or even set up a complete project office for administrative matters such
as keeping files, the financial administration, recording the hours
worked, and correspondence (also see Section 6.14).

### Information
Make sure that all interested parties (stakeholders) are well informed
throughout the project. The nature of the information is highly diverse and
includes information:

- Relevant to the project members
- Relevant to the sponsor, steering committee (if any) and departmental
managers involved in the project
- Relevant to the user of the end product of the project
- Relevant to anyone who is ‘inconvenienced’ by the project
If the project is complex, you can carry out a stakeholder analysis in which
you indicate who is involved and who has an interest in the project for
every stakeholder. The stakeholder analysis can be used to determine who
should produce which information and who should receive which
information. This can be displayed in an information matrix. The ‘Sample
information matrix’ can be downloaded from the website.

There might be a considerable amount of resistance to the project. That is
because projects often result in change and not everyone is comfortable
with change. A mega project involving the construction of a new railway line
or freeway section can expect considerable resistance from environmental
groups and neighbouring residents. But projects that also result in major
change within organisations will not always be considered positive. That is
why those working on projects involving reorganisation, the implementation
of new working methods or the automation of work processes should
always expect some degree of resistance. Before a project is started up,
arrangements should be made to ‘sell’ the project to the outside world and
involve the end users.

Large projects have members who take care of the public relations (PR)
aspect of the project. They are responsible for ‘selling’ the project to the
stakeholders (all those involved) and sometimes writing a complete
communication plan based on the stakeholder analysis. It is a good idea to
review your list of project activities (Section 3 of your project plan) to make
sure you have taken this problem sufficiently into consideration.

### Coordination
Effective collaboration depends on good coordination of the activities. This
applies both to the project activities as well as the activities involving the
outside environment. The following tips will help you coordinate the project
effectively:

-	Establish how often and when you are going to hold meetings with the
project team, the steering committee and the sponsor. Who will receive
an agenda and the minutes?
- Together with the sponsor, establish how the project’s members should
record their time. Usually this will be via a weekly record of the hours
worked (also see Section 3.13, ‘Monitoring the progress’). A ‘Time
registration form’ can be downloaded from the website to use as
reference. In an organisation where project-based work practices are
common, the time records can usually be done by computer. The
participants enter their hours worked under the project in question
directly from their workstations. Calculations are done on the basis of
each participant’s hourly rate and financial information relating to the
time spent on a project is then readily available.
- Indicate whether you want a written weekly report from the members of
the project team. A weekly report will contain a description of what was
done the previous week. The activities that are planned for the following
week may also be included in the weekly report.
- If you wish to maintain communication between members of the project
team and others by e-mail, clear agreements must be made about how
this should be done. It may include reading one’s e-mail at least once a
day.
-	Set up a filing system for the project.
-	Establish which digital tools you plan to use for
collaborating within your project group.

## Planning and Scheduling
Once you know what the project’s activities are, what products are
involved, what the project’s milestones will be, and who is part of the
project’s team, you can start drawing up the planning. A planning provides
an overview of activities in relation to time. A planning also indicates which
members of the project team have been assigned to various activities. A
planning enables you to estimate how long a project is going to take and
how much it will cost. For more detailed information on the drawing up of a
planning, see Chapter 4 in this book.
The following approach may be applied to drawing up a schedule:

- Transfer the activities listed in Section 6.5 to a table of activities (see
Table 4.3).
- Include the duration and possibly also the required working time per
activity in the table.
- Indicate what dependencies there are between the activities.
-	Draw a network diagram if necessary.
-	Draw a Gantt chart.
If available, consider using computer planning software.

## Costs and Benefits
Carrying out a project always takes time, and therefore costs money. It
also involves use of other resources (for example, building materials), and
has to produce something: the yield or benefits. It is up to the sponsor to
weigh up the costs against the benefits and decide whether or not the
project should be carried out. If the benefits are not greater than the costs,
you should seriously consider not undertaking the project.

A project is likely to involve the following costs:

-	Man-hours (required working time). These hours can be converted into
money by multiplying them by the hourly rates. Do not forget to include
the time required to manage the project.
-	Other resources. These could include the cost of materials, housing,
acquisition of equipment, hiring technical aids and printing costs.
-	Exploitation costs. These are costs incurred after the project has been
completed. Exploitation costs do not necessarily have to be mentioned in
the project plan. If, for example, the project outcome is a building, knowing
the cost of the building will suffice. What the sponsor will be doing during
the usage – exploitation – of the building is irrelevant to the building
project. If necessary, consult with the sponsor about whether or not he
wants a calculation of exploitation costs included in the project plan.

Unexpected expenditure may be included in the budget as an additional
cost. This could, for example, be 10% of the overall costs. This will have to
be negotiated with the sponsor. When you are calculating the costs you
might have to assume some things. Make sure that these assumptions are
clear to the sponsor and show how the calculation was made.

With the benefits show how you arrived at that figure and what
assumptions you have had to make. It can be hard to express benefits in
monetary terms: how do you translate better quality, for example, into
money? Depending on the sponsor, you might be able to give global cost
benefit estimate, or if the sponsor has already decided to give the project
the go-ahead, you might leave the benefits out altogether. If you do so,
make sure that you mention this in Costs and benefits of the
project plan. If you do include a cost benefit analysis,
using a spreadsheet model like MS Excel is the best way of going about it.

## Risks
Carrying out a risk analysis makes the risks more visible and easier to
discuss. This analysis is an excellent tool for looking ahead. It is carried
out as follows:
### Make a list of possible risks
Try to obtain an accurate and comprehensive picture of the project risks
that threaten your project. You can do this through, for example,
brainstorming. You can also inquire into the reasons and what kinds of
actions have already been taken to avoid these risks.
### Analyse the risks
After taking stock of the risks, you need to analyse them. The various
methods that can be used are not discussed here in any detail. The
following is the global process for every project risk identified:

-	Examine the reasons of the possible risk. If the risk is a simple one, you
can do this ‘by feel’. A ‘herringbone diagram’ can be used for more
complicated risks. This analysis method is not covered here, but can
easily be found online.
-	Estimate the probability of the risky event occurring.
-	Estimate the maximum harm (consequence) of the event if it occurs.

Next, draw up a list of the most important risks in order of priority. When
determining measures to be taken, you will have to give precedence to
those risks with the highest priority. The relevant risks, likelihood of them
occurring, maximum scope of the damage and priority are all included on
the risk list. Now that you have an idea of the greatest risks relevant to
your project, you can determine the necessary measures in response.

### Formulate measures
Using the above list, determine together with the sponsor which measures
are possible and what they will cost. Next, make a list of priorities. There
are several approaches to dealing with risks:

- Preventative. You take measures to avoid the risk: you eliminate the
risk by omitting certain activities or choosing a different solution.
- Repressive. You take measures to reduce the risk: you limit the
possibility of damage or the extent of the damage.
- Transference. You take measures to transfer the risk: you have
someone else assume the risk, such as a supplier or insurance
company. This usually involves a cost. If you have part or all of the
project carried out by a supplier in a structural manner, this is called
contracting out or outsourcing. The supplier essentially runs the risks
for the activities that have been outsourced. Keep in mind that, should
something go wrong at your supplier’s, you may still be affected by it.
- Acceptance. You accept the risk and do not take any measures.
